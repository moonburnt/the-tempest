# The Tempest

## Description

**The Tempest** - temporary filesharing site, powered by flask+mongodb. Right now
its on early development state, but planned features include the following:

- Ability to share files for limited amount of time
- Both anonymous and authorized uploads
- Ability to specify different file keeping lengths (say, between a hour to day,
maybe longer for authorized users)
- Ability to limit downloads by time, access amounts (say, to only allow to download
file once) and specific users list (obviously will require authorization)
- Strict no-js policy, except where unavoidable

## Installation

## QA

TODO. The only thing I can say for now is that Im primary making it as personal
project, in order to get used to mongodb and flask better.
